aido-less nave, transcpts each trith two eaetern chapels, a choi:
111111 aisles, arrd on the south side ol it a building including tro
chapcls, one above another, aud probably a chapter-heure und
sacriety, while the erossing wne crowned by n 11111 central toret.
'lbere is nothing to show how the cheir ended 1111111111111 the
nave westward.¹ The first great alteration ·ii indeed Rege&
chureh was ever finished westwnrdr was the buildiug ol the
present west lront including the torrere. attributed to Arch-
lrislrop Gray, 1216-55. The next was the rebuilding ol the
eastern portion ol the cheir, nt the end ol the same century,
when it is described as ruinous and in imminent danger²
(11.14, 15, 23). Το this period belongs the fine geometrical
deeoratcd work ol the present east end, unfinished in 1328
( 11. 98). 1111111111111111111111111 raulted with wood on
11111111 optingere, and appears 1ο have heen covered trith lead in

The high altar stood one bey from the east end, the sedilia
being r'then 111 the last arch hutone. The shrine ol St. wil-
frid would be 111 the space behind the high altar if, as is,
pro 1111 11111, the usual arrangement obtained. It appears to hare s
co ntained only the head According to the accounts which we
1111111, llic body was originally buried on the south side ol the
«1111111111, near the altar ol St.. Peter (Ι. 2911). Thea, putting
trside ldedtner‘s story about Odo (l. 3111111111 3) we find that.
11111111111111111111111111 opened the ‘sarcophngus,'and placed the
whole ol tho relies in a chest on the north side, translating
11111111, in leet, froin one side of the church to the other (I. 30,
11). 11111111, in 1224, Archbishop Gray, haring scrutiniscd the
11111111, translated all except the skull from the old chest into a
new 111111, 11111 the ‘head' he cnshrined externally aud in an
111111111111111111 rnarrncr (l. 50). Lcland seems to be referring to the
11111111 11111 relies, not 1ο the head, when he says 1111181111]-
lrid's relies, buried under 1111 arch near the high altar, hed
letely been removed (l. 87). References to the shrine will bc
